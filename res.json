{"headline": ["Paradigming Is Hard"], "text": [" sends us to , who tries hard to be sympathetic to the latest hard science/engineering guy bustling in to show those dumb economists how to do it. But as Fox clearly realizes, the reason we don\u2019t have a new economic paradigm isn\u2019t that economists are dumb, or even that all of them are rigid in their beliefs (obviously some are, or I wouldn\u2019t have as many arguments as I do.) The reason, instead, is that it\u2019s hard.Specifically: we have a body of economic theory built around the assumptions of perfectly rational behavior and perfectly functioning markets. Any economist with a grain of sense \u2014 which is to say, maybe half the profession? \u2014 knows that this is very much an abstraction, to be modified whenever the evidence suggests that it\u2019s going wrong. But nobody has come up with general rules for making such modifications. So, on the behavioral side, clearly people aren\u2019t perfectly rational \u2014 but there are lots of ways to be slightly stupid, and it\u2019s very hard to come up with a general theory about which of these ways they will choose in any given situation. Behavioral economics is a fine thing, but it\u2019s more a collection of interesting and sometimes useful observations than a general, well, paradigm that can offer guidance across a wide range of cases.Meanwhile, markets also fail much of the time \u2014 but while we know a fair bit about what happens to particular markets in practice, we don\u2019t seem close to a general paradigm here either.So how do you do useful economics? In general, what we really do is combine maximization-and-equilibrium as a first cut with a variety of ad hoc modifications reflecting what seem to be empirical regularities about how both individual behavior and markets depart from this idealized case. And people using this kind of rough-and-ready approach have done really well since 2008, on everything from inflation to interest rates to the effects of austerity.But here\u2019s the thing: economists have done their work this way for generations. So it\u2019s really not a new paradigm. If anything, the true new paradigm was the attempt to justify everything with maximization and equilibrium \u2014 but that\u2019s the paradigm that failed.Now maybe, someday, someone will find a way to do something truly new \u2014 integrate neuroscience into economics for real, not as a marginal research topic, or turn agent-based models into a useful tool. I\u2019m for it! But merely noting the foolishness of some economists and calling for a new paradigm in the abstract won\u2019t get us there."]}

{"headline": ["Macroeconomics and Class Warfare"], "text": ["Back when Obama was proposing a spending plan to boost the economy, and some of us were pleading for a bigger plan, it was common to hear people from both the right and the  declaring that it was all a ruse, an attempt to smuggle in liberal priorities under the guise of fiscal stimulus. This was, as it happens, completely false \u2013 and in the case of the right-wingers, a case of projection. After all, Obama didn\u2019t try to sell permanent spending increases as short-run stimulus \u2013 but Bush did exactly that when pushing his tax cuts.And what\u2019s more, it wouldn\u2019t have worked. If anything, your best bet is to try it the other way \u2013 to push proposals that will stimulate the economy while also building infrastructure and/or reducing inequality, and to make the long-run, class-warfare aspects the heart of your sales pitch.This may seem odd. Shouldn\u2019t it be easier to sell win-win ideas, which will make everyone or almost everyone better off? Well, it would be if the public \u201cgot\u201d Keynesian economics. But even educated readers tend not to get the idea that the economy as a whole can suffer from inadequate demand (hey, lots of U. of Chicago professors don\u2019t get it either.) And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for want of efforts to get the point across.The key sticking point is right at the beginning. Never mind monetary and fiscal policy; the very notion that the economy can suffer from too little spending turns out to be inherently difficult. When I give public talks, I get some traction (I think) by asking people what happens if everyone tries to cut his or her spending at the same time, then pointing out that my spending is your income and your spending is my income. But I don\u2019t think it sticks for many people: the appeal of the economy-as-household metaphor usually takes over.I\u2019m not making this judgment entirely based on gut feelings. We do have some metrics here \u2013 imperfect metrics, but still useful. Look, for example, at book sales: Has there ever been a monster bestseller about fighting recessions, or even about growth for its own sake? I don\u2019t think so. The blockbusters are always, one way or another, about us versus them \u2013 going head to head, competing in a flat world, or now trying to stop the rise of the one percent. In saying this I don\u2019t mean to denigrate the last entry: Piketty\u2019s book is awesomely good, and deserves all the acclaim it\u2019s getting. But it is notable that in a time of deeply depressed labor markets, our biggest thing is long-run inequality.Or closer to home, I do of course track how my columns do on the most-emailed list; and there\u2019s no question that inequality gets a bigger response than demand-side macro.This doesn\u2019t mean that we should (or that I will) stop trying to get the truth about depression economics across. But it\u2019s an interesting observation, and I think it has implications for how politicians should go about doing the right thing."]}

Equally surprising \u2014 at least to me \u2014 is that Cochrane seems more aware of the difficulties of the issue.The basic idea both writers share is that banks as we know them \u2014 institutions that issue promises to pay money on, or almost on, demand, while holding liquid assets that cover only a fraction of that potential demand \u2014 are inherently subject to runs, self-fulfilling losses of confidence. So they propose that we aim to eliminate such institutions; there would still be things we call banks, but they would simply be custodians of government-issued liquid assets.Wolf, unless I\u2019m reading him wrong, seems to identify the whole issue with one particular form of short-term debt \u2014 bank deposits. This seems an oddly narrow view given the nature of the 2008 crisis, which involved very few runs on deposits but a massive run on shadow banking, especially repo \u2014 overnight lending that in a fundamental sense fulfilled the functions of deposit banking but also created the same kind of risks. Cochrane gets this, and calls for a \u201cPigouvian tax\u201d \u2014 i.e., the kind of tax economics textbooks tell us we should have on pollution \u2014 imposed on any form of \u201crun-prone short-term debt\u201d. So, three thoughts.First, Wolf\u2019s omission is a big one. If we impose 100% reserve requirements on depository institutions, but stop there, we\u2019ll just drive even more finance into shadow banking, and make the system even riskier.Second, Cochrane\u2019s proposal calls for a remarkable amount of government intervention in finance; it makes liberal proposals for a transactions tax look like minor nuisances. Cochrane insists that we can easily run our economy without dangerous short-term private debt \u2014 that we can easily set things up so that the manager of your index fund sells a tiny piece of your stock portfolio every time you use a debit card at 7-11.

{"headline": ["Frustrations of the Heterodox"], "text": ["It\u2019s kind of a sideshow in the larger scheme of things, but something worth noting is taking place on the fringes (literally) of economic discussion: an upwelling of frustration on the part of heterodox economists. You see it in  about gattopardo economics, which I ; you see it in the demands for a  in the economics curriculum, which Simon Wren-Lewis . I understand the frustration, but the heterodox need to realize that they have, to an important extent, been working with the wrong story line.Here\u2019s the story they tell themselves: the failure of economists to predict the global economic crisis (and the poor policy response thereto), plus the surge in inequality, show the failure of conventional economic analysis. So it\u2019s time to dethrone the whole thing \u2014 basically, the whole edifice dating back to Samuelson\u2019s 1948 textbook \u2014 and give other schools of thought equal time.Unfortunately for the heterodox (and arguably for the world), this gets the story of what actually happened almost completely wrong.It is true that economists failed to predict the 2008 crisis (and so did almost everyone). But this wasn\u2019t because economics lacked the tools to understand such things \u2014 we\u2019ve long had a pretty good understanding of the logic of banking crises. What happened instead was a failure of real-world observation \u2014 failure to notice the rising importance of shadow banking. Economists looked at conventional banks, saw that they were protected by deposit insurance, and failed to realize that more than half the de facto banking system didn\u2019t look like that anymore. This was a case of myopia \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t a deep conceptual failure. And as soon as people  recognize the importance of shadow banking, the whole thing instantly fell into place: we were looking at a classic financial crisis.What about the lousy policy response \u2014 austerity and all that? The key point here was that policymakers weren\u2019t basing their decisions on conventional economics. On the contrary, they decided to blow off textbook macroeconomics and embrace exotic doctrines like expansionary austerity and a mysterious growth cliff at 90 percent debt relative to GDP. The disastrous policy responses that have perpetuated the slump are the result of mainstream economics having too little influence, not too much."]}
{"headline": ["Piketty and Pareto"], "text": ["Well, it\u2019s Piketty day at the Times, with  and  even having more or less matching headlines. And David\u2019s take reminds me of something I\u2019ve been meaning to do: explain one important point in Piketty that even economist readers have, it seems, tended to miss.In his critique David says of Piketty,So, two points. Piketty doesn\u2019t just assert that fortunes will concentrate, he shows that they have in fact concentrated in the past. That\u2019s the whole point of his extended analysis of Belle Epoque France, with its dominance by inherited wealth. And for every Bill Gates, there are many families that do all they can to perpetuate dynastic wealth. Remember, the 10 wealthiest Americans include 4 Waltons and two Kochs.Second, Piketty predicts a high concentration of wealth, but not concentration without limit. He alludes to his modeling here rather than presenting it explicitly, but maybe he should have said more. Here\u2019s how I think of it. Imagine that once a family acquires a certain level of wealth, it tends to engage in dynastic accumulation, consuming only a fraction of its asset returns while saving the rest and passing it on. However, there is in each generation some probability that the family fortune will be squandered by a wastrel.In this case there will be an equilibrium distribution of family fortunes, comprising families that have accumulated wealth for three generations, a smaller number who have accumulated for four generations (smaller because some fortunes get squandered), a still smaller number who have accumulated for five generations, and so on.How much wealthier will five-generation dynasties be than four-generation? It depends on the rate of return r \u2014 and their share of wealth also depends on the growth rate g. Furthermore, six-generation dynasties will be to five-gens as five gens are to four, etc.. The distribution of wealth will follow a Pareto distribution (which is true of actual wealth distributions at the top), with the exponent depending on r minus g.So no dynasty lasts forever; there will be a slow \u201ccirculation of elites.\u201d But some dynasties will last a long time \u2014 and if the after-tax rate of return is high, those dynasties will control a large share of wealth.And let me add something here: if you think you\u2019ve found an obvious hole, empirical or logical, in Piketty, you\u2019re very probably wrong. He\u2019s done his homework!"]}
{"headline": ["On Gattopardo Economics"], "text": ["FT Alphaville sends us to  on Piketty and his boosters. Palley raises an interesting point, one that I\u2019m hearing from some other people on the left: they\u2019re disappointed that Piketty\u2019s book relies mainly on conventional, mainstream economics.And it\u2019s mostly true. For the most part Piketty works with an \u201caggregate production function\u201d in which labor works with a stock of capital to produce output, and both labor and capital are paid their marginal product \u2014 the rate of return on capital is equal to the amount an extra dollar\u2019s worth of capital adds to production. True, when discussing the rise of \u201csupermanagers\u201d Piketty talks about imperfect competition and rents, but that\u2019s not the core of his work.So Palley and others are disappointed; and Palley worries that at least as far as doctrine is concerned, this could be \u201cgattopardo economics\u201d \u2014 the reference is to the novel, made into a Visconti movie, about how Sicilian aristocrats manage to maintain their position despite Garibaldi and the coming of democracy, by wooing and co-opting the bourgeoisie. Note: the aristocrats Palley has in mind are not Piketty\u2019s oligarchs but mainstream economists like, well, me.And I have some sympathy for his point \u2014 although if the suggestion is that people like me are jumping on the inequality bandwagon late, that just isn\u2019t true; I was  literally decades ago.The thing to bear in mind, however, is that you really don\u2019t need to reject standard economics either to explain high inequality or to consider it a bad thing. There are a few economists on the left who seem to believe that:1. You need to believe in the existence of a perfectly well-defined aggregate measure of capital to believe in the marginal productivity theory of income distribution;\n2. If you believe in, or even use, marginal productivity theory, you are conceding that capitalists deserve their income.Neither of these things are true. Nothing about marginal productivity theory depends on the exact truth of a simple aggregate production function with capital defined by a single number. And saying that capital gets its marginal product in no way says that the people who own that capital deserve what they get.So by all means let\u2019s continue to debate how we do economics. But inequality really isn\u2019t a wedge issue in that discussion. You can be perfectly conventional in your economics \u2014 or, my own attitude and what I think is Piketty\u2019s, willing to use conventional models when they\u2019re convenient and seem useful without treating them as irrefutable truth \u2014 while still taking inequality very seriously."]}
